# RL-based traffic data reporting scheme for vehicular networks
Vehicles with OBUs can communicate with the roadside infrastructures (\textit{e.g.,} RSUs and 5G base station), edge servers and cloud (\textit{e.g.,} cellular communication and vehicular networking) to report trafﬁc-related data and request/receive urban-related dynamics (\textit{e.g.}, trafﬁc conditions). 
The vehicles need to sense the environment and frequently report trafﬁc-related information to enable accurate trafﬁc condition estimation and detect congestion. Therefore, if all vehicles try to report simultaneously, they can overload the network with redundant transmissions and degrade the overall system performance. 
Thus, the traffic data reporting mechanism needs to be optimized to reduce network overhead. This is am RL-based data reporting scheme aiming to minimize the network overhead when the vehicles report their traffic information.
